A comprehensive collection of agent skills for hardening VPS servers against common security threats. Based on industry best practices and real-world attack prevention strategies.

## 🎯 What is This?

This repository contains [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) for securing Virtual Private Servers (VPS). These skills enable AI coding assistants to automatically configure server security following proven hardening techniques.

**Within 60 seconds of spinning up a new VPS, someone is already trying to break in.** Automated bots constantly scan the entire internet looking for vulnerable servers. These skills help you secure your server before attackers find it.

## 📦 Available Skills

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [auto-updates](secure-server-setup/auto-updates/) | Configure automatic security updates to patch vulnerabilities |
| [ssh-hardening](secure-server-setup/ssh-hardening/) | Disable root login, enforce SSH keys, create non-root users |
| [firewall-configuration](secure-server-setup/firewall-configuration/) | Set up UFW firewall with default-deny policies |
| [fail2ban-setup](secure-server-setup/fail2ban-setup/) | Automatically ban IPs showing brute-force behavior |
| [backup-strategy](secure-server-setup/backup-strategy/) | Implement automated backups with off-server storage |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

Install all security skills using the skills CLI:

```bash
npx skills add mikr13/secure-server-setup-skills
```

Or clone manually to your skills directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mikr13/secure-server-setup-skills.git ~/.skills/secure-server
```

### Usage with AI Assistants

Once installed, prompt your AI assistant:

```
Harden my new Ubuntu VPS server with all security best practices
```

Or target specific security areas:

```
Set up SSH hardening and firewall on my server
```

```
Configure automatic backups to AWS S3
```

## ✅ Emergency 10-Minute Hardening

No time for the full security setup? Here's the absolute minimum you should do on a new VPS:

```bash
# Update everything
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Create non-root user
adduser deployer && usermod -aG sudo deployer

# Basic firewall
sudo apt install ufw
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
sudo ufw allow ssh
sudo ufw enable

# Fail2ban with defaults
sudo apt install fail2ban
sudo systemctl enable fail2ban

# Disable root password login
sudo passwd -l root
```

**Then:** Set up SSH keys, disable password authentication, and configure proper backups as soon as possible.

## 📋 VPS Security Checklist

Use this checklist for every new VPS:

- [ ] Update all packages
- [ ] Enable automatic security updates
- [ ] Create non-root user with sudo
- [ ] Set up SSH key authentication
- [ ] Disable password authentication
- [ ] Disable root login
- [ ] Configure firewall (UFW)
- [ ] Install Fail2ban
- [ ] Disable unnecessary services
- [ ] Set up off-server backups

## 🎓 Why These Skills?

### The Problem

Most VPS instances have the same critical mistakes:

1. **Not updating the system** - Running known-vulnerable software
2. **Logging in as root** - One typo can destroy everything
3. **Using password authentication** - Passwords can be brute-forced
4. **No firewall** - Every port accessible to the internet
5. **No brute-force protection** - Bots hammering login attempts 24/7
6. **Running unnecessary services** - More attack surface
7. **No backups** - Can't recover from compromise

### The Solution

These skills fix all of these issues systematically:

- **Auto-updates**: Patches known vulnerabilities automatically
- **SSH hardening**: Keys instead of passwords, no root access
- **Firewall**: Default deny, whitelist required services only
- **Fail2ban**: Three strikes and you're banned for an hour
- **Backups**: Quick recovery if something goes wrong

## ⚠️ Security Notice

These skills implement defense in depth - multiple layers of security working together. No single measure is perfect, but combined they significantly reduce your attack surface.

**Most attackers are lazy.** They're looking for default passwords, unpatched software, and misconfigured services. Make your server slightly harder than the next one, and they'll move on.

**Remember:** Security is not a one-time setup. Regular updates, monitoring, and testing are essential for maintaining a secure server.
